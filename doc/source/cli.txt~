The fdb Command Line for Fluidinfo
==================================

A Brief Overview of Fluidinfo
-----------------------------

Fluidinfo is a simple, shared, online storage system in which each
there are a set of objects, each of which can optionally be *about*
something, and information is stored by tagging objects.
Tags belong to users, and have names.   Tags may store information
simply by being present or absent, or they may have values.
Thus I  can indicate that I have read a book by attaching a tag
called ``have-read`` to the object corresponding to that book,
or I can rate it by attaching a ``rating`` tag with a numeric value
to the object.   Tag owners can set permissions on their tags
to control who can see them and who can alter/use them.
So tags are owned and are subject to a permissions system and policies,
while all objects are shared.

Overview of the Command Line
----------------------------

The fdb command line is a acts as a sort-of one-shot command shell
for Fluidinfo.   It gives access to much of the functionality of
the underlying ``fdb.py`` library, with a main focus on tagging,
getting tag values, finding tags, querying Fluidinfo and clearing
(removing tags).
It also has some facilities for listing tags and viewing and
altering their permissions.

Assuming you have installed fdb.py, set up a credentials file,
and created an alias ``fdb`` to run it, basic use is exemplified
as follows.   In the examples that follow, I assume that the Fluidinfo
user has username ``njr``.   All tags belonging to njr start ``njr/``.
(``fdb`` actually has a configuration option to allow this to be omitted,
but for now we'll specify the user explicitly, since that is normal
in Fluidinfo.)


  1. Rate the Eiffel Tower as a 9:
     ::

         $ fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating=9

  2. Show the my rating and ntoll's rating of the "Eiffel Tower".
     ::

        $ fdb show -a "Eiffel Tower"  fluiddb/about  njr/rating  ntoll/rating 
	Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
	/objects/93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
  	njr/rating = 9
  	fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"
  	ntoll/rating = "I prefer the one in Blackpool"

  3. Show all the tags on the "Eiffel Tower" (now referenced by ID):
     ::

        $ fdb tags -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
	Object with id=93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4:
        njr/rating = 9
        ntoll/rating = "I prefer the  the one in Blackpool"
	njr/location = "Paris"
	njr/indexed/about
	fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"

  4. Add a ``dislike`` tag to each object that I have rated 1 or 0
     and then show their about tags.
     ::

        $ fdb tag -q 'njr/rating < 2' njr/dislike
        $ fdb show -q 'has njr/dislike' fluiddb/about njr/rating njr/dislike
        5 objects matched
        Object a98f2c80-ae5f-405a-a319-d47122ae9da3:
          fluiddb/about = "book:foucaults pendulum (umberto eco)"
          njr/rating = 1
          njr/dislike = True
        Object 5157c69e-ceaf-4e7c-9423-d67751d029d3:
          fluiddb/about = "The_Beatles"
          njr/rating = 1
          njr/dislike = True
        Object 1ab066e8-c2a1-4769-9121-e3346849e7e4:
          fluiddb/about = "book:beloved (toni morrison)"
          njr/rating = 1
          njr/dislike = True
        Object ff873602-e9a8-4f9a-a7d4-c0cfc394a120:
          fluiddb/about = "book:the lord of the rings (jrr tolkien)"
          njr/rating = 1
          njr/dislike = True
        Object 7aed1e67-a88e-439d-8a56-b2ab52c838ab:
          fluiddb/about = "book:oranges are not the only fruit (jeanette winterson)"
          njr/rating = 0
          njr/dislike = True


Before describing these commands in detail, it will be useful
to describe the abstraction ``fdb`` uses, as it differs in key
respects from the underlying Fluidinfo model.

The fdb Abstraction
-------------------

The Fluidinfo API is quite low level and rigid;
``fdb`` offers a slightly higher level of abstraction.
Here, we briefly note the differences.

  * In the Fluidinfo API, you can't simply tag an object with
    an ``njr/rating`` tag; you first have to tell the system that you
    wish to use a ``rating`` tag by ``creating`` it; only once you
    have done this can you use it.

    In ``fdb``, you can just go ahead and set a tag; if it doesn't
    exist, the system will create it for you.

  * Fluidinfo supports *namespaces*; a namespace is to a tag much
    like a directory or folder is to a file, i.e. tags live in
    namespaces and you can have different tags with the same name in
    different namspaces, just as you can have two files with the same
    name in different folders.   User Jacqui (username ``jacqui``)
    has a namespace
    ``jacqui``, and she can create tags ("top-level tags") in that
    namespace.   Jacqui may, however, wish to group tags into sets
    using namespaces.   For example, she may wish to have some private
    tags that all live in a namespace called ``private``.   So she might
    have a private rating tag called ``jacqui/private/rating``.
    As with tags, Fluidinfo first requires jacqui to create the ``private``
    namespace before she can create the ``jacqui/private/rating`` tag.
    So to use ``jacqui/private/rating`` for the first time, using the
    API directly, the process would be:

      1. Create the namespace ``private`` under ``jacqui``
      2. Create the tag ``rating``
      3. Tag the relevant object with ``rating``.

   Again, ``fdb`` takes care of all that, and allows jacqui just
   to say:
   ::

      fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" jacqui/rating=10

   ``fdb`` will create any tags and namespaces required on the fly.

  * Finally, in Fluidinfo itself, the object ID (128-bit number,
    usually formatted as a hex-number in 8-4-4-4-12 digit groups)
    is not actually a tag on the object.   ``fdb`` allows the user
    to use refer to it as a tag, at least for reporting purposes,
    using the name ``/id``.


The Anatomy of the core fdb Commands
------------------------------------

The general form of the core fdb commands is:
::

   fdb <verb> [flags] <object selector> <tags/values>

The verb says what you want to do.   The main verbs currently avalaible are

  * ``tag`` --- set tags on some objects
  * ``show`` --- show tag values from some objects
  * ``untag`` --- remove tags from some objects
  * ``tags`` --- show what readable tags an object has
  * ``count`` --- count the number of objects match some criterion.

The optional ``flags`` modify the command.   The main ones used are:

  * ``-v`` --- verbose (gives extra information)
  * ``-s`` --- to specify that the command should operate againss the sandbox
    (``sandbox.fluidinfo.com``) rather than the main Fluidinfo instance
    (``fluiddb.fluidinfo.com``); this is mostly used for testing.
  * ``-U`` --- use unix-style paths (overriding configuration and default;
    see below)
  * ``-F`` --- use Fluidinfo-style paths (overriding configuration and
    default; see below)
  * ``-u userspec`` --- if you have multiple Fluidinfo accounts, this
    specifies an alternate credentials file to use, normally identified
    by the username (see below).

The ``<object selector>`` is used to specify which objects you are interested
in and usually takes on of three forms:

  * ``-a "about tag value"`` is used to specify an object on the basis of
    its about tag (``fluiddb/about``).   For example,
    ``-a "book:nineteen eighty four (george orwell)"`` specifies an important
    book by George Orwell.

  * ``-i ID`` is used to specify an object on the basis of its
    ID (expressed as a hex string, appropriately formatted).
    For example, ``-i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``
    specifies the object with this ID, which happens to be the
    on with the about tag ``Eiffel Tower``.

  * ``-q "fluidinfo query"`` is used to specify a set of objects
    on the basis of a query expressed in the Fluidinfo query language.
    For example ``-q has njr/rating`` specifies objects that have
    an njr/rating rag on them.

Finally, some commands need or accept a list of tags or tag-value pairs.
Specifically, ``show`` and ``untag`` both require a list of tags to be
shown or removed, and ``tag`` requires a set of tag-value pairs to know
what tags to set.   Tag value pairs usually take the form:
::

    tag=value

so that a list of them might be
::

    rating=9 description="fabulous" seen=true price = 18.77

(fdb is not too fussy about whether you put spaces around equals signs
or not.)

In general, strings should be in double quotes ``"like this"``,
booleans should be ``true``,
``false``, ``t`` or ``f`` (unquoted) and numbers should just be plain numbers
like 3 or 4.7.
All strings are always unicode, i.e. they may contain any character.

It is also possible to set a tag without a value by just giving a tag name.

Command Reference
-----------------

fdb tag
*******

Adds one or more tags (with optional values) to the object or objects
specified.

**FORM**
::

    fdb tag [flags] <object specifier> <tag-value-pairs>

**EXAMPLES**
::

    fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating=7 njr/seen
    fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating = 7 njr/seen
    fdb tag -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 njr/rating=7 njr/seen
    fdb tag -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' njr/rating=7 njr/seen
    fdb tag -U -a "Eiffel Tower" rating=7 seen

All of these commands will tag the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower"
and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4`` with two
tags---``njr/rating`` of 7 and ``njr/seen`` with no value.
The last one may also tag other objects since the query
::

    fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.

The ``-U`` option specifies "unix-style" relative paths; when this option
is used, tag names are assumed to be relative to the authenticated user's
namespace; if other user's tags are to be referred to, they must be
introduced with a leading ``/`` (e.g. ``/ntoll/rating).
Note that ``-U`` does not affect queries specified with ``-q``,
i.e. full Fluidinfo-style paths must be used inside the query.

The command produces no output when successful and a suitable
warning when it fails.
::

  $ fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating=7

  $ fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating=7
  Failed to tag object with about="Eiffel Tower" with ntoll/rating
  Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTES**

When specified by about tag, the object does not need to exist
in Fluidinfo prior to the operation; if necessary an object with
the given about tag will be created.   (Conceptually, an object
for every possible about tag always exists in Fluidinfo;
they are just *instantiated lazily*, i.e. allocated IDs when first used.)

The user must have permission to write the tag.
By default, the user can write any tag under her namespace.


fdb untag
*********

Removes one or more tags from the object or objects specified.

**FORM**
::

    fdb untag [flags] <object specifier> <tags>

**EXAMPLES**
::

    fdb untag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen
    fdb untag -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen
    fdb untag -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 njr/rating njr/seen
    fdb untag -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' njr/rating njr/seen
    fdb untag -U -a "Eiffel Tower" rating seen

All of these commands will remove the tags ``njr/rating``
and ``njr/seen`` from the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower"
and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``;
The last one may also tag other objects since the query
::

    fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.

The ``-U`` option specifies "unix-style" relative paths; when this option
is used, tag names are assumed to be relative to the authenticated user's
namespace; if other user's tags are to be referred to, they must be
introduced with a leading ``/`` (e.g. ``/ntoll/rating).
Note that ``-U`` does not affect queries specified with ``-q``,
i.e. full Fluidinfo-style paths must be used inside the query.

The command produces no output when successful, even if the tag did
not exist.

$ fdb untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating  
Failed to remove tag ntoll/rating from object with about="Eiffel Tower"
Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTE**

The user's ability to remove tags from objects is governed by
the permissions system.


fdb show
********

Shows the values of the tags nominated from the objects specified.

**FORM**
::

    fdb show [flags] <object specifier> <tags>

**EXAMPLES**
::

    $ fdb show -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
    Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
      njr/rating = 7
      njr/seen
      (tag ntoll/seen not present)

Alternative specifications:
::

    fdb show -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
    fdb show -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
    fdb show -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
    fdb show -U -a "Eiffel Tower" rating seen ntoll/seen

All of these commands will show the values the tags ``njr/rating``,
``njr/seen`` and ``ntoll/seen`` from the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower"
and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``;
The last one may also show other objects since the query
::

    fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.

The ``-U`` option specifies "unix-style" relative paths; when this option
is used, tag names are assumed to be relative to the authenticated user's
namespace; if other user's tags are to be referred to, they must be
introduced with a leading ``/`` (e.g. ``/ntoll/rating).
Note that ``-U`` does not affect queries specified with ``-q``,
i.e. full Fluidinfo-style paths must be used inside the query.

The command produces no output when successful, even if the tag did
not exist.
::

  $ fdb untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating  
  Failed to remove tag ntoll/rating from object with about="Eiffel Tower"
  Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTE**

The user's ability to read tags is regulated by the permissions system.


fdb tags
********

Show the list of tags (and their values) present on an objects

**FORM**
::

    fdb tag [flags] <object specifier>

**EXAMPLES**
::

    $ fdb tags -a "Eiffel Tower" njr/rating njr/seen ntoll/seen
    Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
    /objects/93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
      njr/seen
      fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"
      njr/njr/seen
      njr/rating = 7
      njr/index/about
      njr/location = "Paris"


Alternative specifications:
::

    fdb tags -a "Eiffel Tower"
    fdb tags -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
    fdb tags -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"'

All of these commands will show the names and values of all the tags
(for which the user has read permission)
from the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower"
and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``;
The last one may also show other objects since the query
::

    fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.


fdb count
*********

Counts the number of objects matching a set of conditions

**FORM**
::

    fdb count [flags] <object specifier>

**EXAMPLES**
::

    $ fdb count -q 'has njr/rating'
    141 objects matched
    Total: 141 objects

    $ fdb count -a 'Eiffel Tower'
    Total: 1 object

    $ fdb count -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"'
    6 objects matched
    Total: 6 objects

The command produces no output when successful, even if the tag did
not exist.
::

  $ fdb untag -F -a "Eiffel Tower" ntoll/rating  
  Failed to remove tag ntoll/rating from object with about="Eiffel Tower"
  Error code 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)

**NOTES**

The Fluidinfo API does not provide a primitive ``count`` function,
so FDB actually has to retrieve all the objects that match the query
and count them; this operation can, therefore, be comparatively slow.

The user's ability to read tags is regulated by the permissions system,
so the count reflects that, i.e. it is the restricted to objects
that the user can see the relevant tags for.


fdb ls
******

The ``ls`` command is used to view a sorted list of tags or namespaces,
potentially with additional information.

**FORM**
::

    ls [flags] [<namespace>|<tag>]

**EXAMPLES**

  #. List the tags in the user's namespace:

     (Here, we assume we are authenticated as user ``miro``):
     ::
  
       $ fdb ls
       bestsellers-1998-2010/    first_field_id            n_records                
       bestsellers1998to2010/    first_record_id           next-field-about

       field-name                has_about_links           small/                   
       field-number              has_field_numbers         surname                  
       field_number              has_id_links              table-name               
       first-field-about         has_record_numbers        testconvtag              
       first-field-id            message                   testrating               
       first-record-about        n-fields                  testtable/               
       first-record-id           n-records                 type                     
       first_field_about         n_fields                  unit
     
     Note that namespaces are shown with a trailing ``/``; for users familiar
     with the unix ``ls`` command, this is modelled on ``ls -F``.

  #. List the tags and subnamespaces in a given namespace:
     ::
     
       $ fdb ls miro/planets
       Atmosphere                Mass                      OrbitalRadius            
       Category                  Moons                     RotationPeriod           
       EquatorialDiameter        Name                      db-next-record-about

       Inclination               OrbitalPeriod
   
     Sort order is case-sensitive, e.g. (in English) all lower-case letters
     follow upper-case letters.

  #. List a single tag (report presence or absence of that tag).
     ::

       $ fdb ls miro/planets/Mass
       miro/planets/Mass

       $ fdb ls -F miro/planets/NoMass
       miro/planets/NoMass not found

  #. Long listing for tag (``njr/rating``), including permissions summary:
     ::
    
       $ fdb ls -l njr/rating
       trwcr--r--   rating
    
     See the section on permissions for a full explanation of the permissions
     string.   Briefly
    
      * the first ``t`` indicates that this is a tag rather
        than a namespace
    
      * the next three characters indicate that the owner (``njr``)
        has read, write and control permission on the tag,
    
      * the next three characters indicate that any group exceptions have
        read permission only on the tag
    
      * and the final three characters indicate that everyone (world)
        has read permission but not write or control permission
        on the tag.

  #. Longer listing for tag (``njr/rating``), including Fluidinfo-style
     permissions summary:
     ::

      The first ``n`` indicates that ``njr/index`` is a namespace rather than
      a tag.   This option may be specified using ``-n`` (for namespace)
      or ``-d`` (for directory) since the latter will probably be more natural
      for users familiar with unix-style ``ls``.
    
      See the section on permissions for an explanation of the permissions
      string.

  #. Long listing including group details (for tag ``njr/rating``)
     ::
    
       $ fdb ls -ln njr/fi
       nrwcr-----   ceronman+esteve+jkakar+ntoll+terrycojones fi
    
     See the section on permissions for an explanation of the permissions
     string.   In this case
    
      * the first ``n`` indicates that this is a namespace
    
      * the next three characters indicate that the owner (``njr``)
        has read, write and control permission on the tag,
    
      * the next three characters indicate that members of the
        exception group exceptions have read ("list") permission
        on the tag (but not write or control permissions).
    
      * the final three characters indicate that Fluidinfo users
        other than the owner and the people in the exception group
        do not have any permissions to read, write or control the namespace.
    
     The list of users separated by plus signs is the list of
     users on the exceptions list.

     The next example shows Fluidinfo's native representation of the
     permissions for this namespace.

  #. Longer listing for namspace (``njr/fi``), including Fluidinfo-style
     permissions summary:
     ::

       Permissions for namespace njr/fi:
    
       READ:
         list (read):        policy: closed; exceptions: [ceronman, esteve, jkakar, njr, ntoll, terrycojones]
    
       WRITE:
         create (create):    policy: closed; exceptions: [njr]
         update (metadata):  policy: closed; exceptions: [njr]
         delete (delete):    policy: closed; exceptions: [njr]

         control (control):  policy: closed; exceptions: [njr]
    


fdb su
******

Set user: changes the set of credentials in use by ``fdb``.

**FORM**
::

    fdb su userspec

**EXAMPLES**
::

    fdb su foo

The ``fdb`` command expects user credentials for Fluidinfo to be stored
in a file in the users's home directory.   On unix systems, this file
is ``~/.fluidDBcredentials``; on Windows systems it is
``fluiddbcredentials.ini`` in the user's home folder..

The the user has access to more than on Fluidinfo account, multiple
credentials may be stored in variant files.   In unix systems,
these files have names like ``~/.fluidDBcredentials.foo``;
on windows they have names like ``fluiddbcredentials-foo.ini``.

A different set of credentials can be used for any one-off command
by adding ``-u foo`` to the command line; this will cause the credentials
in the ``foo`` variant of the file to be used.

The ``fdb su command`` changes the default set of credentials to be used
by copying the specified variant file over the default file.
Because it is a simple copy, this is a *global* change, i.e. it affects
all sessions, not just one in the current shell.    So on unix,
::

    fdb su njr

is exactly equivalent to
::

   cp ~/.fluidDBcredentials.njr ~/.fluidDBcredentials


fdb whoami
**********

Shows the username name of the current user credentials.
**FORM**
::

   fdb whoami


**EXAMPLES**
::

    $ fdb whoami

    $ fdb su greek
    Credentials set to user Νικολας (file greek).

    $ fdb whoami
    Νικολας


fdb pwd / fdb pwn
*****************

For the moment, ``fdb pwd`` and ``fdb pwn`` (print working directory/namespace)
both execute ``fdb whoami``.
At some point in the future, ``fdb`` may support the notion of a working
namespace and a ``cd`` command; this is only really relevant if the
user chooses to use unix-style paths with ``fdb``.


fdb test
********

Runs fdb's self-tests.

**FORM**
::

   fdb test [flags] [subset to run]
   fdb testcli
   fdb testapi
   fdb testdb

The only normally relevant flag is ``-s``, to run against the sandbox.

The ``testcli``, ``testdb`` and ``testapi`` variants run subets of the tests.

**EXAMPLE**
::

  $ fdb test
  ......................
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 22 tests in 47.210s

Everything is running correctly if you get a line of dots with no
``E`` (error) or ``F`` failures.




fdb help
********

Shows help information.


fdb ``--version``
*****************

Reports the version of fdb running; ``-V`` may be used as a short form.




Installation and Configuration
==============================

**IMPORTANT CHANGE** From version 2.00 onwards, Fluidinfo
has become more conventional; see `Tag Conventions`

Download
--------

fdb is available from Github at https://github.com/njr0/fdb (use the
download button).   Place fluiddb somewhere on your python path
(environment variable ``PYTHONPATH``).


Dependencies
------------

If you're running python 2.6, fdb.py should just run.   With earlier
version of python, you need to get access to simplejson and httplib2.
You can get simplejson from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/
and httplib2 from http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/.


Making the fdb command available
--------------------------------

The file ``fdb`` included in the download is executable provided that
a suitable python is installed.    You can make it available more
conveniently by using a shell alias or adding a symbolic link to it
somewhere on your ``PATH``.   For example:
::

  alias fdb='/path/to/fdb'

or, if `~/bin` is on your ``PATH``:
::

  cd ~/bin
  ln -s /path/to/fdb



fdb Python Library and Command Line
-----------------------------------

fdb is a primarily a command line tool for providing access to the
Fluidinfo data store (from Fluidinfo (http://fluidinfo.com/.)
There is lots of coverage of the library (and its evolution) at
http://blog.abouttag.com/.

fdb can also be used as a python library for accessing Fluidinfo, but
it is less complete and less conventional the Ali Afshar's FOM library
(https://launchpad.net/fom), which is generally preferred for
programmatic use.


Credentials
-----------

For many operations, you also need an account on FluidDB,
and credentials (a username and password).   You can get these from

    http://fluidinfo.com/accounts/new

fdb expects your credentials to be available in a two-line file
in the format

username
password

On Unix, the default location for this is ~/.fluidDBcredentials,
and on Windows the default file is fluidDBcredentials.ini in your
home folder.

You can also optionally add a line, after password, saying either

unix-style-paths true
or unix-style-paths false

(see next section)

Tag Conventions
---------------

As from version 2.00, fdb uses absolute Fluidinfo-style paths all the time
(i.e. you always specify the namespace and don't use a leading slash).
You can explicitly mandate this also by adding the line

unix-style-paths false

in your credentials file (see above).

If you instead set 

unix-style-paths true

on the third line of the credentials file, fdb uses unix-style paths,
meaning that paths are assumed to be relative to the user's namespace
unless they are introduced with a leading slash.  Also, the about tag
(fluiddb/about) may be referred to as /about.  This affects input and
output.

If you want to overrride this behaviour for a given command,
you can use the -U flag to specify that the command will use
unix-style paths, or -F to indicate that it will use fluidinfo-style
paths.


Tests
-----

The library includes a set of tests.   If you have valid credentials,
and everything is OK, these should run successfully if you just execute
the file fdb.py.   

See `fdb test`_.


Using the Library
-----------------

Four ways of exploring the library are:

  1. look at the tests (the ones in the class TestFluidDB)

  2. look at the blog (http://abouttag.blogspot.com)

  3. read the function documentation in the source.

  4. look at and run example.py, which should print DADGAD and 10.


Documentation
-------------

This documentation is included with the release in the ``doc``
subdirectory of with doc/build/html/index.html being the main
web page.

Delicious
---------

Also distributed with fdb itself is code for accessing delicious.com
(http://del.icio.us/, as was), and for migrating bookmarks and other
data to FluidDB.   This also includes functionality for creating web
homepages from delicious based on a home tag.   See the README-DELICIOUS
file for details on this functionality.
