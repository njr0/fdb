The fdb Command Line
====================

A Brief Overview of Fluidinfo
-----------------------------

Fluidinfo is a simple, shared, online storage system in which each
there are a set of objects, each of which can optionally be *about*
something, and information is stored by tagging objects.
Tags belong to users, and have names.   Tags may store information
simply by being present or absent, or they may have values.
Thus I can indicate that I have read a book by attaching a tag
called ``have-read`` to the object corresponding to that book,
or I can rate it by attaching a ``rating`` tag with a numeric value
to the object.   Tag owners can set permissions on their tags
to control who can see them and who can alter/use them.
So tags are owned and are subject to a permissions system and policies,
while all objects are shared.

Overview of the Command Line
----------------------------

The fdb command line is a acts as a sort-of one-shot command shell
for Fluidinfo.   It gives access to much of the functionality of
the underlying ``fdb.py`` library, with a main focus on tagging,
getting tag values, finding tags, querying Fluidinfo and clearing
(removing tags).

Assuming you have installed fdb.py, set up a credentials file,
and created an alias ``fdb`` to run it, basic use is exemplified
as follows.   In the examples that follow, I assume that the Fluidinfo
user has username ``njr``.


  1. Rate the Eiffel Tower as a 9:
     ::

         $ fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" rating=9

  2. Show the my rating and @ntoll's rating of the "Eiffel Tower".
     ::

        $ fdb show -a "Eiffel Tower"  /about  rating  /ntoll/rating 
	Object with about="Eiffel Tower":
	/objects/93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
  	/njr/rating = 9
  	/fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"
  	/ntoll/rating = "I prefer the one in Blackpool"

  3. Show all the tags on the "Eiffel Tower" (now referenced by ID):
     ::

        $ fdb tags -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4
	Object with id=93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4:
        /njr/rating = 9
        /ntoll/rating = "I prefer the  the one in Blackpool"
	/njr/location = "Paris"
	/njr/indexed/about
	/fluiddb/about = "Eiffel Tower"

  4. Add a ``dislike`` tag to each object that I have rated 1 or 0
     and then show their about tags.
     ::

        $ fdb tag -q 'njr/rating < 2' dislike
        $ fdb tag -q 'has dislike' /about
        ... (get from blog post)

Before describing these commands in detail, it will be useful
to describe the abstraction ``fdb`` uses, as it differs in key
respects from the underlying Fluidinfo model.

The fdb Abstraction
-------------------

The Fluidinfo API is quite low level and rigid;
``fdb`` offers a slightly higher level of abstraction.
Here, we briefly note the differences.

  * In the Fluidinfo API, you can't simply tag an object with
    a ``rating`` tag; you first have to tell the system that you
    wish to use a ``rating`` tag by ``creating`` it; only once you
    have done this can you use it.

    In ``fdb``, you can just go ahead and set a tag; if it doesn't
    exist, the system will create it for you.

  * Fluidinfo supports *namespaces*; a namespace is to a tag much
    like a directory or folder is to a file, i.e. tags live in
    namespaces and you can have different tags with the same name in
    different namspaces, just as you can have two files with the same
    name in different folders.   User Jacqui (username ``jacqui``)
    has a namespace
    ``jacqui``, and she can create tags ("top-level tags") in that
    namespace.   Jacqui may, however, wish to group tags into sets
    using namespaces.   For example, she may wish to have some private
    tags that all live in a namespace called ``private``.   So she might
    have a private rating tag called ``jacqui/private/rating``.
    As with tags, Fluidinfo first requires jacqui to create the ``private``
    namespace before she can create the ``jacqui/private/rating`` tag.
    So to use ``jacqui/private/rating`` for the first time, using the
    API directly, the process would be:

      1. Create the namespace ``private`` under ``jacqui``
      2. Create the tag ``rating``
      3. Tag the relevant object with ``rating``.

   Again, ``fdb`` takes care of all that, and allows jacqui just
   to say:
   ::

      fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" rating=10

   ``fdb`` will create any tags and namespaces required on the fly.

  * Fluidinfo always uses full tag paths, i.e. to use her ``rating``
    tag, Jacqui always has to call it ``jacqui/rating``.
    fdb allows jacqui to refer to it simply as ``rating``.
    If she needs to refer to someone else's tag, she simply puts
    a slash in front of the full path.   So for Jacqui, in ``fdb``,
    ``rating`` refers to her rating tag, but ``/njr/rating`` refers
    to mine.

    Some user's don't like this facility; ``fdb`` has both a
    configuration option (``unix-style-paths false``)
    and a command-line flag (``-F``) to make the fdb command line
    accept only full Fluidinfo-style paths.

  * The Fluidinfo root user, ``fluiddb`` maintains a tag generally
    referred to as *the* about tag; its full path is ``fluiddb/about``.
    This tag is special in that, if it is set, it uniquely and
    permanently identifies an object; in this sense, it can be used
    as an alternative to the object ID in many cases.
    No two objects ever share an about tag.
    When choosing where to place information in Fluidinfo,
    the about tag is the usual way of deciding.

    Recognizing the special place the the *about* tag has,
    ``fdb`` allows users to refer to it as ``/about`` rather
    than ``fluiddb/about``.   Again, this facility is removed
    if the user chooses not to use unix-style paths.

  * Finally, in Fluidinfo itself, the object ID (128-bit number,
    usually formatted as a hex-number in 8-4-4-4-12 digit groups)
    is not actually a tag on the object.   ``fdb`` allows the user
    to use refer to it as a tag, at least for reporting purposes,
    using the name ``/id``.


The Anatomy of an fdb Command
-----------------------------

The general form of fdb commands is:
::

   fdb <verb> [flags] <object selector> <tags/values>

The verb says what you want to do.   The main verbs currently avalaible are

  * ``tag`` --- set tags on some objects
  * ``show`` --- show tag values from some objects
  * ``untag`` --- remove tags from some objects
  * ``tags`` --- show what readable tags an object has
  * ``count`` --- count the number of objects match some criterion.

The optional ``flags`` modify the command.   The main ones used are

  * ``-v`` --- verbose (gives extra information)
  * ``-F`` --- use Fluidinfo-style paths (overriding configuration and default)
  * ``-U`` --- use unix-style paths (overriding configuration and default)

The ``<object selector>`` is used to specify which objects you are interested
in and usually takes on of three forms:

  * ``-a "about tag value"`` is used to specify an object on the basis of
    its about tag.   For example,
    ``-a "book:nineteen eighty four (george orwell)" specifies an important
    book by George Orwell.

  * ``-i ID`` is used to specify an object on the basis of its
    ID (expressed as a hex string, appropriately formatted).
    For example, ``-i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4``
    specifies the object with this ID, which happens to be the
    on with the about tag ``Eiffel Tower``.

  * ``-q "fluidinfo query"`` is used to specify a set of objects
    on the basis of a query expressed in the Fluidinfo query language.
    For example ``-q has njr/rating`` specifies objects that have
    an njr/rating rag on them.
    (N.B. ``fdb`` does *not* currently rewrite queries, so they need
    to use Fluidinfo conventions for tag paths, i.e. only absolute
    addressing with full paths and no leading slash.   This is
    obviously inconsistent and will, hopefully, change in the future.

Finally, some commands need or accept a list of tags or tag-value pairs.
Specifically, ``show`` and ``untag`` both require a list of tags to be
shown or removed, and ``tag`` requires a set of tag-value pairs to know
what tags to set.   Tag value pairs usually take the form:
::

    tag=value

so that a list of them might be
::

    rating=9 description="fabulous" seen=true price = 18.77

In general, strings should be in quotes, booleans should be true, false, t
or f (unquoted) and numbers should just be plain numbers.

It is also possible to set a tag without a value by just giving a tag name.

Command Reference
-----------------

fdb tag
*******

Form:
::

    fdb tag [flags] <object specifier> <tag-value-pairs>

Examples:
::

    fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" rating=7 seen
    fdb tag -a "Eiffel Tower" /njr/rating = 7 seen
    fdb tag -i 93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4 rating=7 seen
    fdb tag -q 'fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"' rating=7 seen

All of these commands will tag the object with about tag "Eiffel Tower"
and ID ``93bd1999-0998-49cc-8004-af457ce34ce4`` with two
tags---``njr/rating`` of 7 and ``seen`` with no value.
The last one may also tag other objects since the query
::

    fluiddb/about matches "Eiffel Tower"

is search-engine-style string match that will match any about tag
containing the words ``Eiffel`` and ``Tower``, ignoring case, other words
and punctuation.
