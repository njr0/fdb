Using Unix-Like Paths
=====================

In Fluidinfo, all paths (namespaces and tags) are absolute and have no
leading slash.  So ``njr`'s rating tag is ``njr/rating`` and must
always be specified as such.

This contrasts with Unix, where there is a notion of relative and absolute
paths.   Absolute paths start with a slash and specify how to get to
the item you are interested in.   So, if we map namespaces to directories
and tags to files, then the unix equivalent of ``njr/rating`` is
``/njr/rating``.   But Unix also has a notion of a ``current working
directory`` (``cwd``) and relative paths---the path to the file or directory
of interest relative to the working directory.   Thus if the ``cwd`` is
``njr``, then ``/njr/rating`` can be referred to as ``rating``.
Unix uses the ``cd`` command to allow you to change your working directory,
and ``pwd`` to print the name of the working directory.

``fdb`` supports a limited version of the same.   There are two ways
to tell ``fdb`` that you would like to use unix-style paths rather than
fluidinfo-style paths.   First, on any command line, you can add
a ``-U`` flag, and this will have the desired effect for that command only.
Thus
::

    ls -l njr/rating

and
::

    ls -F -l rating

have the same effect.  (The ``-F`` and ``-l`` can also be combined as
``-lF`` or ``-Fl`` since they are single letter flags that don't take
arguments.)

Alternatively, if you would always like to use unix-style paths,
you can add a third line to your `Credentials` file saying
::

  unix-style-paths true

What Changes with Unix-Style Paths
----------------------------------

If you choose to use unix-style paths, the following changes occur:

  * All paths not beginning with a ``/`` are taken to be relative
    to the user's namespace.   So if you authenticate as ``njr``,
    then ``rating`` is a shorthand for ``/njr/rating``
    (the Fluidinfo tag ``njr/rating``),
    ``private/rating`` is a shorthand for ``/njr/private/rating``.

  * Paths in other users' namespaces must be introduced with a slash.
    Thus, to refer to ``jacqui``'s rating, use ``/jacqui/rating`` etc.
    For example,
    ::

       fdb show -a DADGAD rating /jacqui/rating

    will request the Fluidinfo tags ``njr/rating`` and ``jacqui/rating``.

  * The *about tag*, ``fluiddb/about`` may be referred to with the
    special abbreviation ``/about``.
    For example,
    ::

       fdb show -a DADGAD rating /jacqui/rating /about

    (though requesting the about tag for an object specified by about
    tag is obviously a bit pointless).

  * The pseudo-tag ``/id`` may be used to request the object's ID.

  * The exception to this is in the body of queries: ``fdb`` does not
    rewrite queries, which are passed directly to Fluidinfo.
    Thus, to request the about tags for all objects containing DADGAD,
    you would say:
    ::

       fdb show -q 'fluiddb/about matches "DADGAD"' /about

    Similarly, to request all objects ``njr`` has rated 10:
    ::

       fdb show -q 'njr/rating = 10' /about 

**NOTES**

  * At present, although there is a ``pwd`` command, it always simply
    returns the authenticated user's username; there is no ``cd``
    command at present.   This may change.

  * It is quite likely that at some point in the future, when unix paths
    are in use, ``fdb`` will rewrite queries too, i.e. unix-style
    paths will be extended to the query; however, that is a slightly more
    delicate operation, so hasn't been tackled yet.
