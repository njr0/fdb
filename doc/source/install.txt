Installation and Configuration
==============================

**IMPORTANT CHANGE** From version 2.00 onwards, Fluidinfo
has become more conventional; see `Tag Conventions`

Download
--------

fdb is available from Github at https://github.com/njr0/fdb (use the
download button).   Place fluiddb somewhere on your python path
(environment variable ``PYTHONPATH``).


Dependencies
------------

If you're running python 2.6, fdb.py should just run.   With earlier
version of python, you need to get access to simplejson and httplib2.
You can get simplejson from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson/
and httplib2 from http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/.


Making the fdb command available
--------------------------------

The file ``fdb`` included in the download is executable provided that
a suitable python is installed.    You can make it available more
conveniently by using a shell alias or adding a symbolic link to it
somewhere on your ``PATH``.   For example:
::

  alias fdb='/path/to/fdb'

or, if ``~/bin`` is on your ``PATH``:
::

  cd ~/bin
  ln -s /path/to/fdb



The fdb Python Library and Command Line
---------------------------------------

fdb is a primarily a command line tool for providing access to the
Fluidinfo data store (from Fluidinfo (http://fluidinfo.com/.)
There is lots of coverage of the library (and its evolution) at
http://blog.abouttag.com/.

fdb can also be used as a python library for accessing Fluidinfo, but
it is less complete and less conventional the Ali Afshar's FOM library
(https://launchpad.net/fom), which is generally preferred for
programmatic use.


Credentials
-----------

For many operations, you also need an account on FluidDB,
and credentials (a username and password).   You can get these from

    http://fluidinfo.com/accounts/new

fdb expects your credentials to be available in a two-line file
in the format

username
password

On Unix, the default location for this is ~/.fluidDBcredentials,
and on Windows the default file is fluidDBcredentials.ini in your
home folder.

You can also optionally add a line, after password, saying either

unix-style-paths true
or unix-style-paths false

(see next section)

Tag Conventions
---------------

As from version 2.00, fdb uses absolute Fluidinfo-style paths all the time
(i.e. you always specify the namespace and don't use a leading slash).
You can explicitly mandate this also by adding the line
::

    unix-style-paths false

in your credentials file (see above).
If you instead set 
::

    unix-style-paths true

on the third line of the credentials file, fdb uses unix-style paths,
meaning that paths are assumed to be relative to the user's namespace
unless they are introduced with a leading slash.  Also, the about tag
(fluiddb/about) may be referred to as /about.  This affects input and
output.

If you want to overrride this behaviour for a given command,
you can use the ``-U`` flag to specify that the command will use
unix-style paths, or ``-F`` to indicate that it will use fluidinfo-style
paths.


Tests
-----

The library includes a set of tests.   If you have valid credentials,
and everything is OK, these should run successfully if you just execute
the file fdb.py.   

See :ref:`fdbtest`.


Using the Library
-----------------

Four ways of exploring the library are:

  1. look at the tests (the ones in the class TestFluidDB)

  2. look at the blog (http://abouttag.blogspot.com)

  3. read the function documentation in the source.

  4. look at and run example.py, which should print DADGAD and 10.


Documentation
-------------

This documentation is included with the release in the ``doc``
subdirectory of with doc/build/html/index.html being the main
web page.

Delicious
---------

Also distributed with fdb itself is code for accessing delicious.com
(http://del.icio.us/, as was), and for migrating bookmarks and other
data to FluidDB.   This also includes functionality for creating web
homepages from delicious based on a home tag.   See the README-DELICIOUS
file for details on this functionality.
